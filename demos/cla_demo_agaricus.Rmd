## Mushrooms

Data set is loaded with the column names (.names file).
We should always look at the raw data file to check for the correctness of
the data format and how to handle it.
We cast every column as a factor, since all the features are categorical
and we thus let the data frame know of it as well.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(tidymodels)

data <- read_csv("data/agaricus-lepiota-expanded.data",
                 col_names = c("edibility",
                              "cap-shape", "cap-surface", "cap-color",
                               "bruises", "odor", "gill-attachment", "gill-spacing",
                               "gill-size", "gill-color", "stalk-shape", "stalk-root",
                               "stalk-surface-above-ring", "stalk-surface-below-ring",
                               "stalk-color-above-ring", "stalk-color-below-ring",
                               "veil-type", "veil-color", "ring-number", "ring-type",
                               "spore-print-color", "population", "habitat")) %>%
  mutate(across(everything(), as.factor))
```

### Explore the data

One way to understand the relationship of predictors with a nominal outcome is
to plot proportions of levels of each feature "stratified" by outcome.
Bring the data frame into long format by using `pivot_longer` on all the columns
except edibility to collect the variables under a columns named "predictor" and
the values under a column named "value".
We need to then find the proportion of edibility for each value of each predictor.
This is done by `count` on predictor, value, and edibility followed by `group_by`
on predictor and value and finally create a new column named "prop" with `mutate`.
Hint: `mutate(prop = n / sum(n))` gives the proportion of each row in its group (indicated by group_by).

```{r, fig.width=10, fig.height=10, fig.retina=1}
data %>%
  pivot_longer(!edibility, names_to = "predictor", values_to = "value") %>%
  count(predictor, value, edibility) %>%
  group_by(predictor, value) %>%
  mutate(prop = n / sum(n)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = value, y = prop, fill = edibility)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge") +
  facet_wrap(~ predictor, scale = "free_x") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 1, hjust = 1))
```


### Data split

Create the data split. 

```{r}
split_data <- initial_split(data, prop = 0.75)
train <- training(split_data)
test <- testing(split_data)
```


### Modelling

We'll compare a single decision tree (engine: `rpart`) and random forests (engine: `ranger`).
First, create a recipe to file variables with single values by using `step_nzv` with
the parameter `unique_cut = 0`.
In the random forest:
Set number of trees, minimal node size and the number of randomly selected variables as hyperparameters to tune with `tune()`.
Do not forget to set the mode in the both models.
In the random forest's engine, set the `importance` to impurity to later
compare the predictors in terms of their importance.
Tune the hyperparameters with the seed 2025 and autoplot the results.

```{r}
# Preprocessing for logistic regression: drop singleton columns
recipe <- recipe(edibility ~ ., data = train) %>%
  step_nzv(all_predictors(), unique_cut = 0)

# === Models ===
dt <- decision_tree(cost_complexity = tune(),
                    tree_depth = tune(),
                    min_n = tune()) %>%
  set_mode("classification") %>%
  set_engine("rpart")

rf <- rand_forest(mtry = tune(), trees = tune(), min_n = tune()) %>%
  set_mode(mode = "classification") %>%
  set_engine(engine = "ranger", importance = "impurity")

# === Workflows ===
wf_dt <- workflow() %>%
  add_recipe(recipe) %>%
  add_model(dt)

wf_rf <- workflow() %>%
  add_recipe(recipe) %>%
  add_model(rf)

# Tuning for random forest parameters
set.seed(2025)
folds <- vfold_cv(train, v = 10)
tuned_rf <- tune_grid(wf_rf,
                      resamples = folds,
                      grid = grid_regular(mtry(range = c(2, 22)),
                                          trees(range = c(5, 100)),
                                          min_n(range = c(20, 200)),
                                          levels = c(5, 4, 4)),
                      metrics = metric_set(accuracy))
tuned_dt <- tune_grid(wf_dt,
                      resamples = vfold_cv(train, v = 10),
                      grid = grid_regular(
                        cost_complexity(range = c(-6, -1)),
                        tree_depth(range = c(1, 10)),
                        min_n(range = c(2, 20)),
                        levels = c(4, 4, 3)),
                      metrics = metric_set(accuracy))

autoplot(tuned_rf)

autoplot(tuned_dt)

```

### Finalize and fit

Finalize the workflows with best performing hyperparameters.
We can also visualize the decision tree with the help from rpart package:
`rpart.plot::rpart.plot()` on the fitted model (which you get by
1) extracting workflow, 2) extracting fitted parsnip model, 3) `pluck()`ing
"fit" field.)

```{r}
final_rf <- finalize_model(rf, select_best(tuned_rf, metric = "accuracy"))
fit_rf <- last_fit(final_rf, split = split_data, preprocessor = edibility ~ .,
                   metrics = metric_set(accuracy))

final_dt <- finalize_model(dt, select_best(tuned_dt, metric = "accuracy"))
fit_dt <- last_fit(final_dt, split = split_data, preprocessor = edibility ~ .,
                   metrics = metric_set(accuracy))

fit_dt %>%
  extract_workflow() %>%
  extract_fit_parsnip() %>%
  pluck("fit") %>%
  rpart.plot::rpart.plot()
```

Show the metrics from the test set with `collect_metrics()`.

```{r}
collect_metrics(fit_dt)
collect_metrics(fit_rf)
```


Investigate the importances of variables with `vip`.

```{r}
# library(vip)
vip::vip(fit_rf$.workflow[[1]])
```
