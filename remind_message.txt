You are kindly reminded and encouraged to bring a laptop with RStudio installed in advance.
In the workshop, we will use dplyr and ggplot2 from the tidyverse metapackage for data manipulation and visualization.
So it is advised to have these tidyverse cheatsheets at hand:
    https://rstudio.github.io/cheatsheets/html/data-transformation.html
    https://rstudio.github.io/cheatsheets/html/data-visualization.html

For a smooth begin, it is also worth to have installed the following packages beforehand:
    "tidyverse", "tidymodels", "vip", "corrplot", "naniar"
