In this folder, you find the presentation slides and tasks
in PDF format as well as as .Rmd files that generated the task
PDF.
Rmd files are markdown files with plain text and code blocks,
and you may directly edit, code and plot results in Rstudio.
If you prefer a pure script (.R file) approach,
copy the auxiliary code from the PDFs and continue all
your coding in your script. Whatever goes to your liking :)

Additionally, you'll be provided a data/ folder, where all the
required data sets were collected for you to use in the tasks.

Data sets were not generated by us nor belong to us.
The data sets are from publicly accessible sources.
The sources will have been mentioned in the presentation.
We refer the reader, in any case, not to use the data for
anything other than educational purposes due to reliability
and copyright concerns.
